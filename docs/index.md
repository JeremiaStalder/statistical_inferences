This open educational resource integrates information from my [blog](https://daniellakens.blogspot.com/), my MOOCs [Improving Your Statistical Inferences](https://www.coursera.org/learn/statistical-inferences) and [Improving Your Statistical Questions](https://www.coursera.org/learn/improving-statistical-questions), and my [scientific work](https://scholar.google.nl/citations?user=ZbqYyrsAAAAJ&hl=en). The goal is to make the information more accessible, and easier to update in the future.

I have re-used and adapted (parts of) my own open access articles, without adding quotation marks. Immense grattitude to my collaborators Casper Albers, Farid Anvari, Aaron Caldwell, Harlan Cambell, Nicholas Coles, Lisa DeBruine, Marie Delacre, Zoltan Dienes, Noah van Dongen, Alexander Etz, Ellen Evers, Jaroslav Gottfriend, Seth Green, Christopher Harms, Arianne Herrera-Bennett, Joe Hilgard, Peder Isager, Maximilian Maier, Neil McLatchie, Brian Nosek, Friedrich Pahlke, Pepijn Obels, Amy Orben, Anne Scheel, Janneke Staaks, Leo Tiokhin, Mehmet Tunç, Duygu Uygun Tunç, and Gernot Wassmer, who have contributed substantially to the ideas in this open educational resource. This resource was created during a sabbatical at Padova University, with thanks to the Advanced Data Analysis for Psychological Science students, and Gianmarco Altoè and Ughetta Moscardino for their hospitality.
