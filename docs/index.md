"No book can ever be finished. While working on it we learn just enough to find it immature the moment we turn away from it." 
*Karl Popper, The Open Society and it's Enemies*

This open educational resource integrates information from my [blog](https://daniellakens.blogspot.com/), my MOOCs [Improving Your Statistical Inferences](https://www.coursera.org/learn/statistical-inferences) and [Improving Your Statistical Questions](https://www.coursera.org/learn/improving-statistical-questions), and my [scientific work](https://scholar.google.nl/citations?user=ZbqYyrsAAAAJ&hl=en). The goal is to make the information more accessible, and easier to update in the future.

I have re-used and adapted (parts of) my own open access articles, without adding quotation marks. Immense gratitude to my collaborators Casper Albers, Farid Anvari, Aaron Caldwell, Harlan Cambell, Nicholas Coles, Lisa DeBruine, Marie Delacre, Zoltan Dienes, Noah van Dongen, Alexander Etz, Ellen Evers, Jaroslav Gottfriend, Seth Green, Christopher Harms, Arianne Herrera-Bennett, Joe Hilgard, Peder Isager, Maximilian Maier, Neil McLatchie, Brian Nosek, Friedrich Pahlke, Pepijn Obels, Amy Orben, Anne Scheel, Janneke Staaks, Leo Tiokhin, Mehmet Tunç, Duygu Uygun Tunç, and Gernot Wassmer, who have contributed substantially to the ideas in this open educational resource. I would also like to thank Zeki Akyol, Emrah Er, Lewis Halsey, Kyle Hamilton, David Lane, Jeremiah Lewis, Mike Smith, and Leong Utek who gave comments on GitHub or Twitter to improve this textbook. This resource was created during a sabbatical at Padova University, with thanks to the Advanced Data Analysis for Psychological Science students, and Gianmarco Altoè and Ughetta Moscardino for their hospitality.
